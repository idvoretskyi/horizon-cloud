# Fusion Ops

Fusion Ops is a cloud management service for deploying, managing, and
scaling Fusion applications. The goal is to create an experience that
will allow developers to build a RethinkDB/Fusion app on their laptop,
deploy it with a simple command, and scale the app up and down in a
click of a button.

__NOTE:__ "Fusion" is a codename that we'll likely change in the
future. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/fusion/issues/7.

Fusion Ops will provide the following services:

- __Deployment__ -- foo

Fusion Ops will likely be based on the following rough architecture:

- __Foobar__ -- bar
